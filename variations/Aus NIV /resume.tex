\cvsection[\faHandHoldingHeart]{Contribution to Australia's National Interest}

\begin{raggedright}
I currently architect critical data infrastructure for Australia's National Electricity Market at Vector Technology Solutions. This infrastructure processes telemetry for Blue Current—a sovereign asset co-owned by the Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC)—serving 2.7 million smart meters. The serverless architecture I contribute to enables the grid stability required for Australia's Net Zero transition. Simultaneously, I develop machine learning solutions for infrastructure mapping (PSPS) in California, transferring global wildfire mitigation best practices to Australia.

  \vspace{0.5cm}
With a PhD in Big Data (2024), I address the high failure rate of data projects through resilient distributed systems. My reference architecture, Terramycelium (2025), demonstrates processing of 771,305 messages with 0.0000148s latency, supporting Australia's low-emission technology goals.
