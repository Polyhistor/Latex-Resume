Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Staff Software Engineer/Principal Software Engineer position at Databricks. With over 10 years of experience as a software engineer and a PhD in Big Data, I believe I bring a unique blend of academic research and practical engineering skills that align well with Databricks' mission to enable data teams to solve the world's toughest problems.

Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to build highly scalable, available, and fault-tolerant systems that process massive amounts of data. I have hands-on experience with technologies such as Kafka, Elasticsearch, and Kubernetes, and I am comfortable working with cloud platforms like AWS. My deep understanding of distributed systems, data structures, and algorithms allows me to design and implement efficient solutions to complex problems.

I have studied Databricks before and am familiar with its capabilities and potential. I believe my expertise in big data systems, combined with my passion for innovation and teamwork, would make me a valuable addition to your engineering organization.

In addition to my technical skills, I have a proven track record of leadership and mentorship. I have served as a Tech Lead, Lead Architect, and Development Leader, driving critical technological decisions and fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration. I am committed to delivering customer value and impact, and I thrive in an environment where I can work towards a multi-year vision with incremental deliverables.

My PhD research focused on big data reference architectures and the application of microservices patterns to big data systems. This academic background, coupled with my industry experience, has equipped me with a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the big data landscape. I am eager to apply this knowledge to help Databricks achieve its goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss further how my skills, experience, and passion for big data can contribute to Databricks' success. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team and making a meaningful impact
