Throughout my tenure at IDEXX, I have had the privilege of working closely with the Platform team, contributing to the development and optimization of our cloud-based veterinary software portfolio. From architecting and launching infrastructure for various teams to rewriting frontend pipelines and creating EKS clusters, I have consistently demonstrated my technical expertise and dedication to driving meaningful improvements.

My proficiency in infrastructure as code, particularly with Terraform modules, has enabled me to streamline deployment processes and ensure scalability across our platforms. Additionally, my hands-on experience with tools such as MSK, Confluent Cloud, SonarCloud, Heap, and Datadog has equipped me with the necessary skills to enhance our monitoring, security, and performance optimization efforts.

Having collaborated with the platform team members on numerous projects, I have developed strong relationships and a keen insight into the team's priorities and challenges. This familiarity, coupled with my passion for innovation and continuous improvement, positions me to hit the ground running and contribute immediately to the team's success.
