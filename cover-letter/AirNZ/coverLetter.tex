Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{1em}

When I stumbled upon the Principal Software Engineer (Site Reliability Engineering) position within the Connected Aircraft Squad at Air New Zealand, I couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement. As someone who has been in the trenches of technical leadership, solution architecture, and managing operations and support teams, I knew this was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.

\vspace{1em}

Over the years, I've had my fair share of defining and managing product strategies and technical roadmaps. It's been a wild ride leading teams in delivering enterprise-scale, business-critical, and customer-facing software solutions. But you know what? I've loved every minute of it. Coaching and mentoring technical teams, driving technical outcomes, and ensuring the successful execution of product roadmaps - it's what gets me out of bed in the morning.

Now, when it comes to deploying and supporting cloud-based applications, I'm like a kid in a candy store. Leveraging cloud architecture principles to build scalable, reliable, and maintainable infrastructure and applications? Sign me up! I've got automation, scripting, networking technologies, and database management down pat. And don't even get me started on firewalls and load balancing technologies - I could talk about them for hours.

\vspace{1em}

What really drew me to Air New Zealand is your commitment to building back better and connecting people in the post-pandemic world. The thought of working with a bunch of brilliant minds - SRE, architects, developers, and business subject matter experts - as part of cross-functional squads? It's like a dream come true. And collaborating with application vendors to develop applications that keep aircraft defects at bay and minimize disruption to customers' journeys? Count me in!

Sincerely, \newline
Pouya Ataei.
